This project is to try to make a recipe browser/ seeker that allows the user to enter their items in the pantry. Then after taking those items in the pantry it will scrap the internet
to try and match what the user pantry has to what is on the internet and then return the recipes. Some further plans i have for this is to try to embed it into a website i own.
Possibly AI intergration to give suggestions towards recipes and possibly ingredients. Scraping reviews to sort through them and return the best viewed and highest level reviewed
creating a full interface on my website 
searching a database and adding recipes to a database of recipes
Photo detection of user ingredients and or being able to scan ingrendients for common names of ingredients to add to the list of users ingredients
